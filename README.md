# Potion Crafting & Gathering

This guide provides expanded rules and details for potion brewing and ingredient gathering in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. It focuses on three main toolkits: alchemist supplies, herbalism kit, and poisoner's kit. The document includes:

1. **Recipes**: Guidelines on how to use, obtain, and price recipes for potions and poisons. Recipes are categorized by rarity (common, uncommon, rare, very rare) and include specific ingredients and crafting times.

2. **Ingredient Gathering**: Rules for finding and harvesting plants, fungi, and animal parts. The difficulty of gathering ingredients is based on the environment and the rarity of the items.

3. **Potion Making Leveling System**: A system for gaining experience in potion making. Players can level up their potion-making abilities, gaining bonuses to their crafting checks.

4. **Alchemist Supplies, Herbalism Kit, and Poisoner's Kit**: Detailed contents and uses for each kit, including common to very rare recipes that can be crafted using these kits.

5. **Gatherable Plants and Fungi, Inorganic Materials, Harvestable Creature Parts**: Lists of ingredients that can be gathered from various environments, along with their uses in crafting potions and poisons.

6. **Crafting Rules**: Specific rules for crafting potions, including required materials, time, costs, and the process for making crafting checks.

## Foundry Integration

This content has been adapted to work with FVTT by [action\_jay](<http://www.actionjay.com/>) with appropriate tables and journals. It's intended to be used with the [GMastercrafted](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/mastercrafted) and [Gatherer](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/gatherer) modules to automate the gathering and crafting process but it can be used without the modules.
